# TwitterMap
Uses the Twitter sample stream to show tweets on a world map.
Only shows tweets with geolocation, that's why there is a limited number of tweets.
Hover a country to see the number of tweets from that country.

It can be seen in action [here](http://magnuf.github.io/TwitterMap/)

Draws the map using d3.js with geojson
